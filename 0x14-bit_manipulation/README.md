README for Bit Manipulation
Bit manipulation is the process of manipulating individual bits in a binary number. It is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

Low-level device control: Bit manipulation can be used to directly control hardware devices, such as microcontrollers and peripherals.
Error detection and correction: Bit manipulation can be used to detect and correct errors in data transmission and storage.
Data compression: Bit manipulation can be used to compress data by removing redundant bits.
Encryption algorithms: Bit manipulation is often used in encryption algorithms to scramble data so that it cannot be read by unauthorized individuals.
Optimization: Bit manipulation can be used to optimize code and improve performance.
Getting started
To get started with bit manipulation, you need to understand the basics of binary numbers. Binary numbers are represented by a sequence of bits, where each bit can be either 0 or 1. The value of a binary number is determined by the position of the bits, with the most significant bit on the left and the least significant bit on the right.

For example, the binary number 1010 represents the decimal number 10. This is because the 1 in the leftmost position has a value of 8, the 0 in the second position has a value of 4, the 1 in the third position has a value of 2, and the 0 in the rightmost position has a value of 1.

Once you understand the basics of binary numbers, you can start learning about bit manipulation operations. The most common bit manipulation operations are:

AND: The AND operation takes two binary numbers as input and returns a new binary number that is 1 only if both input bits are 1.
OR: The OR operation takes two binary numbers as input and returns a new binary number that is 1 if either input bit is 1.
NOT: The NOT operation takes a single binary number as input and returns a new binary number that is the opposite of the input number.
XOR: The XOR operation takes two binary numbers as input and returns a new binary number that is 1 if the two input bits are different.
Shift: The shift operation takes a single binary number as input and shifts the bits to the left or right by a specified number of positions.
Bit manipulation operations can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:

Setting and clearing bits: Bit manipulation operations can be used to set or clear individual bits in a binary number.
Checking for bits: Bit manipulation operations can be used to check if a particular bit is set or cleared in a binary number.
Counting bits: Bit manipulation operations can be used to count the number of bits that are set in a binary number.
Extracting bits: Bit manipulation operations can be used to extract a specific range of bits from a binary number.
Converting numbers: Bit manipulation operations can be used to convert binary numbers to other bases, such as decimal and hexadecimal.
