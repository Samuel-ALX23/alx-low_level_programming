Function pointers are a powerful feature in programming languages that allow you to treat functions as variables. Instead of assigning values or objects to variables, you can assign functions to function pointers. This enables you to pass functions as arguments, store them in data structures, and invoke them dynamically at runtime.

This readme provides an overview of function pointers, their syntax, and their common use cases. It aims to help you understand the concept of function pointers and how to use them effectively in your code.
