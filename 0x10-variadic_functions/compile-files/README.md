Purpose
The purpose of the variadic functions source files is to provide the implementation of variadic functions in your codebase. These files contain the necessary logic to handle a variable number of arguments and perform the desired operations or computations based on those arguments.

Source File Structure
The structure of the source files may vary depending on your specific project and programming language conventions. However, a common structure might include the following:

Copy
/src
    - variadic_functions.c
    - additional_code.c
    - ...
In this structure, the variadic_functions.c file contains the implementation of the variadic functions, while other source files may include additional supporting code or utility functions related to variadic functions.
