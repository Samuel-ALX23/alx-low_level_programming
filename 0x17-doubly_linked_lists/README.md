Doubly Linked List
What is a doubly linked list?
A doubly linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and pointers to both the next node in the sequence and the previous node in the sequence. This allows for efficient traversal of the list in both directions.

Advantages of doubly linked lists

Doubly linked lists are faster than singly linked lists for insertion and deletion operations in the middle of the list.
Doubly linked lists are easier to traverse in both directions.
Doubly linked lists can be used to implement stacks and queues.
Disadvantages of doubly linked lists

Doubly linked lists require more memory than singly linked lists because each node stores an additional pointer.
Doubly linked lists can be more complex to implement than singly linked lists.
Implementation
A doubly linked list can be implemented using the following classes:

Python
class
 
Node:

    
def
 
__init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None


class
 
DoublyLinkedList:

    
def
 
__init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

The Node class represents a single node in the list. It contains a value field, a next field that points to the next node in the list, and a prev field that points to the previous node in the list.

The DoublyLinkedList class represents the entire doubly linked list. It contains a head field that points to the first node in the list, and a tail field that points to the last node in the list.

Operations
The following operations can be performed on a doubly linked list:

Insert at the beginning:
Python
def insert_at_beginning(self, value):
    new_node = Node(value)
    if self.head is
 
None:
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
    else:
        new_node.next = self.head
        self.head.prev = new_node
        self.head = new_node

Use code with caution. Learn more
Insert at the end:
Python
def insert_at_end(self, value):
    new_node = Node(value)
    if self.tail is
 
None:
        self.head = new_node
        self.tail = new_node
    else:
        new_node.prev = self.tail
        self.tail.next = new_node
        self.tail = new_node

Insert at a specific index:
Python
def insert_at_index(self, value, index):
    if index < 0 or index > self.size():
        raise IndexError("Invalid index")

    if index == 0:
        self.insert_at_beginning(value)
        return

    if index == self.size():
        self.insert_at_end(value)
        return

    current_node = self.head
    for _ in range(index):
        current_node = current_node.next

    new_node = Node(value)
    new_node.next = current_node
    new_node.prev = current_node.prev
    current_node.prev = new_node
    new_node.prev.next = new_node

Delete at the beginning:
Python
def delete_at_beginning(self):
    if self.head is None:
        return

    if self.head is self.tail:
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
    else:
        self.head = self.head.next
        self.head.prev = None
Use code with caution. Learn more

Delete at the end:
Python
def delete_at_end(self):
    if self.tail is None:
        return

    if self.head is self.tail:
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
    else:
        self.tail = self.tail.prev
        self.tail.next = None
Use code with caution. Learn more

Delete at a specific index:
Python
def delete_at_index(self, index):
    if index < 0 or index >= self.size():
        raise IndexError("Invalid index")

    if index == 0:
        self.delete_at_beginning()
        return

    if index == self.size() - 1:
