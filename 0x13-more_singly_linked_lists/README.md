More singly linked lists

This repository contains a collection of C programs that implement various operations on singly linked lists. The programs are designed to be simple and easy to understand, and they can be used as a starting point for learning more about singly linked lists and data structures in general.

Programs:

create.c: Creates a new singly linked list with a given number of nodes.
insert_at_beginning.c: Inserts a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list.
insert_at_end.c: Inserts a new node at the end of a singly linked list.
insert_after_node.c: Inserts a new node after a given node in a singly linked list.
insert_before_node.c: Inserts a new node before a given node in a singly linked list.
delete_node.c: Deletes a node from a singly linked list.
reverse_list.c: Reverses a singly linked list.
search_list.c: Searches for a given node in a singly linked list.
print_list.c: Prints the contents of a singly linked list.
To compile and run the programs, you will need to have the GCC compiler installed on your system. To compile a program, simply run the following command:

gcc <program_name>.c -o <program_name>
To run a program, simply type the following command:

./<program_name>
For example, to compile and run the create.c program, you would run the following commands:

gcc create.c -o create
./create
This would create a new singly linked list with 10 nodes.

The programs in this repository can be used as a starting point for learning more about singly linked lists and data structures in general. You can modify the programs to implement new operations on singly linked lists, or you can use the programs as a basis for developing your own data structures and algorithms.
